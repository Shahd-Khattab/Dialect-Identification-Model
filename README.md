# Dialect-Identification-Model
Implementation of SVM, LSTM and RNN to identify Arabic dialect
Sequence to run the code:
1. startingFile
2. preprocessing
3. svm
4. lstm/rnn
5. app.py 

The starting file has some data cleaning processes and takes a sample from the dataset to work on.
The preprocessing file has other preprocessing techniques mentioned 
There is embeddingsWay2 it contains word embedding technique such as fasttext however, we continued with tfid vectorizer as the accuracy was low with fastetxt
app.py contains the model local deployment
